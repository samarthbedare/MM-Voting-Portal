# College Voting Portal
We present a desktop application for college elections developed using VB C#, SQL Server technologies. The proposed system is designed to offer a secure, efficient, and reliable platform for students to vote online. The system uses various security measures such as user authentication, data encryption, and secure database management to ensure the security and integrity of the voting process. The system is scalable and can handle a large number of voters and candidates, and includes features such as custom ballot templates and vote counting.
The proposed desktop application uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the presentation, business logic, and data access layers. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with candidate profiles and electronic voting features. The system is fault-tolerant, with failover mechanisms in place to ensure that the system remains available in the event of hardware or software failures. Overall, the proposed college voting system is an effective solution for conducting elections, offering a reliable and efficient platform that can be customized to meet the specific needs of different institutions.
